**It's important that I note here that I'm skipping the rest of this section.  Yes, I know, I shouldn't.  But for the foreseeable future I won't use, or already understand the basics of what's going on in the rest of the numbers section:**
* Division: Classic, floor, and true
* Integer Precision
* Complex Numbers
* Hexadecimal, Octal, and Binary Notation
* Bitwise Operations
* Other Built-in Numeric Types (e.g. sin, pi, etc.)
* The Decimal Type (skipping this one I can see coming back to bite me in the ass...)
* The Fraction Type
