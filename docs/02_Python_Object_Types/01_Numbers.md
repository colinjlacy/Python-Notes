Numbers in Python sound exactly like what they are.  They do exactly what you'd think they do.  Python's syntax can be a bit confusing at times, but it just takes some getting used to.  For example, `2 * 100` is a multiplication, while `2 ** 100` is an exponentation.

For just about every function you'll need a calculator for, you can use Python. At the very least, simple arithmatic can be accomplished with built-in operators.  If you need to get more complicated, you can `import` modules.

Modules that are typically imported to access more complicated operations include some built-in modules like `math` and `random`.

  >>> import math
  >>> math.pi
  3.1415926535897931
  >>> math.sqrt(4)
  2

  >>> import random
  >>> random.random()
  0.59268735266273953
  >>> random.choice([1, 2, 3, 4])
  1

There are also third-party modules for even more complicated mathematical operations, such as vectors and matrices.
